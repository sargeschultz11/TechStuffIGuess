# Fixing Those Cryptic Intune Enrollment Errors Nobody Talks About

We've all been there - attempting to enroll a seemingly innocent Windows device into Intune when suddenly you're confronted with an error code that apparently only makes sense to the deepest corners of Microsoft's development team. Today, I'm tackling three obscure enrollment errors that had me puzzled for longer than I'd like to admit.

## The Dreaded 0x80180014 Error

This error typically appears during autopilot enrollment and basically means "something went wrong, good luck figuring out what." After multiple support tickets and far too much coffee, I discovered the issue is usually related to:

1. Network connectivity to specific Microsoft endpoints
2. A mismatch between the device hash in Autopilot and the actual hardware
3. Time synchronization issues between the device and Microsoft servers

### The Solution That Actually Worked

What fixed it for me was creating a specific firewall exception for the following endpoints:

```
*.manage.microsoft.com
*.login.microsoftonline.com
*.account.microsoft.com
```

But the crucial part was also ensuring the outbound connection was set to allow HTTPS inspection exclusion. Many corporate firewalls inspect HTTPS traffic, which breaks the device attestation process.

## The "Silent Failure" During Company Portal Login

This one had me baffled for weeks. Users would enter their credentials in Company Portal, the app would think for a moment, and then... nothing. No error message, no progress, just an unchanged login screen.

The culprit? An obscure Conditional Access policy that was applying device compliance to the enrollment process itself. It created a perfect circular dependency:

- Device needs to be enrolled to be compliant
- Compliance is required to enroll the device
- ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### How to Fix It

1. Check your Conditional Access policies that target Company Portal and Microsoft Intune enrolled devices
2. Create a specific exception for enrollment-related apps
3. Add the following Microsoft First Party App IDs to your exceptions:
   - d4bef1c3-f7b8-48aa-b517-9db926157b7f (Intune Company Portal)
   - 0000000a-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 (Microsoft Intune Enrollment)

## When "Managed By Your Organization" Just Won't Go Away

This last one is for those strange cases where a device shows the "Managed by your organization" message in Settings, but doesn't appear in Intune. The device is stuck in limbo - neither fully enrolled nor fully free.

The issue typically stems from remnants of a previous MDM enrollment that didn't fully unenroll.

### The Registry Cleanse That Fixed It

1. Open Registry Editor
2. Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Enrollments`
3. Export this key before making changes (seriously, don't skip this step)
4. Look for subkeys with values pointing to your MDM provider
5. Remove those specific keys
6. Restart the device, then attempt re-enrollment

## Conclusion

Intune enrollment errors can be frustratingly vague, but they're usually solvable with a bit of detective work. The most important troubleshooting steps are:

1. Check network connectivity to Microsoft endpoints
2. Verify Conditional Access policies aren't creating circular dependencies
3. Ensure the device is truly clean of previous MDM enrollments
